# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to my Game Developer Portfolio! This document outlines how to contribute to this project.

## Code Style and Standards

- **HTML**: Use semantic HTML5 elements and valid markup
- **CSS**: Follow the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention
- **JavaScript**: Use ES6+ features with appropriate comments for complex functions
- **File names**: Use kebab-case for all file names
- **Indentation**: 2 or 4 spaces (consistent throughout files)

## Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Ensure all code is properly formatted and follows the style guidelines
3. Make sure all code is free of console errors
4. A maintainer will review your PR and either merge it or request changes

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize all images before adding them
- Keep JavaScript functions small and focused
- Avoid large dependencies
- Follow accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1 AA standards)
