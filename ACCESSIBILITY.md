## Testing Accessibility

When making changes to the portfolio, ensure accessibility is maintained by:

1. Testing with keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys)
2. Checking color contrast (use tools like WebAIM's Contrast Checker)
3. Validating with automated testing tools:
   - WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool
   - Axe DevTools
   - Lighthouse Accessibility Audit
4. Testing with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver, or JAWS)
